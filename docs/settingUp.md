# Setting up your dev enviorment

## 1-Install PassMax

PassMax can be installed following the instructions on the install page. We recommend dev install using git, to get the lates technology.

## 2-Create a .gitignore.

Open the PassMax folder in your favourite editor. Then in the source folder create a .gitignore with these settings:

```
.gitignore
pass.txt
import.txt
export.txt
```

## 3-Create a new branch

In your terminal, and in the passmax directory type:

```
git branch my-patch-1
```

(*Note: Repleace my-patch-1 with something else if you want.*)

**DO NOT CREATE PR'S ON THE MAIN BRANCH. THEY WILL BE IGNORED**

## 4-Your all set

Go and develop!
